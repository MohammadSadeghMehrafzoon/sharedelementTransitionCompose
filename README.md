Shared Element Transition in Jetpack Compose

# Introduction to the API
This introduces three new things:

 1. SharedTransitionLayout — This is required to enable the transition animation between the composables.
 2. Modifier.sharedElement() — This should be used when you need to match the other composable.
 3. Modifier.sharedBounds() — This should be used as the container bounds for where the transition should take place.
